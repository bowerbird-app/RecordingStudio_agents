## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added
- MCP tools for chats and items, registered with Recording Studio API so Recording Studio MCP can advertise them. The `agent-chats` skill is registered when MCP is loaded.
- Dummy host mounts Recording Studio Users, Oauth, API, and MCP. ChatKit still uses the session. MCP uses an Oauth bearer token.

### Changed
- The dummy request root is the workspace selected through Root Switchable.
- `create_idempotency_key` is unique per root (`root_recording_id` + key). The same key in another root creates another chat. Item idempotency keys follow the same rule.
- `Binding` and `Item` copy `root_recording_id` from the recording before validation.
- MCP chat tools call `access_grant.authorize!` (`:view` for reads, `:edit` for writes). A missing grant raises `Sessions::AccessDeniedError`, which MCP maps to `RecordingStudioApi::AuthorizationError`.
- ChatKit `find!` returns 404 when the actor cannot view the chat, so a refused workspace does not reveal that the chat exists.
- ChatKit accepts `params.metadata.idempotency_key` when a retry must reuse a key. Client metadata ids are still ignored.
- `agent_chats_list` accepts `root_recording_id` and ignores it. The bearer grant stays the workspace.

### Upgrade notes
- Pin Recording Studio Users `v0.24.0`, Oauth `v0.12.5`, MCP `v0.19.1`, and API `v0.11.4` by git tag. Oauth needs Flatpack `~> 0.1.198` (dummy uses `v0.1.254`). Admin is `v2.3.3`. Metrics stays `v0.3.1` because newer MCP, Root Switchable, and Trashable releases require metrics `< 0.4`.
- Mount API, Oauth, and MCP, allow `RecordingStudioOauth::OauthAuthorization` as an access actor, and point `request_root` at `RecordingStudio::RootSwitchable.resolve_current_root`.
- Deploy the idempotency migrations in order. Migration A, `scope_agents_idempotency_keys_to_root`, adds a nullable `root_recording_id`, backfills it in batches, creates the `(root_recording_id, key)` indexes, then drops the global unique indexes. Migration B, `require_agents_root_on_idempotency_keys`, backfills any rows that arrived after A and then sets `NOT NULL`. Deploy A and the app that copies `root_recording_id` from the recording, then deploy B. A's `down` raises `ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration` because restoring the global unique indexes fails once one key exists in two workspaces. Recording ids are unchanged.
- Set `request_actor` from the session for ChatKit. MCP reads the bearer token's access grant and does not use the browser switcher.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added
- ChatKit `POST /chatkit` endpoint. It speaks the ChatKit thread protocol over JSON and server-sent events, checks Accessible access, and calls Sessions services plus Recording Studio AI. The first turn is read from the provider stream, and from saved items when that stream has no text, because create is not streamed.
- `recording_studio_agents_chatkit` renders the official `<openai-chatkit>` component against that endpoint, with the session cookie, CSRF token, and `config.chatkit_domain_key`. When `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CHATKIT_DOMAIN_KEY` is missing, it renders a setup notice.

### Upgrade notes
- Set `request_actor` and `request_root` so the endpoint can resolve the signed-in actor and the root.
- Set `config.openai_api_key` from `OPENAI_API_KEY` or Rails credentials through Recording Studio AI.
- Register the page origin in the OpenAI domain allowlist and set `config.chatkit_domain_key` from `CHATKIT_DOMAIN_KEY`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added
- `Session` recordable ("Chat") registered under the `:agents` capability.
- `Binding` and `Item` tables for provider session identity, retention, and the local item projection.
- `Sessions::Create`, `Append`, `Rename`, and `Close`. Close deletes the provider session through Recording Studio AI and treats an already-gone session as success. User actions require Accessible edit access on the chat, inherited from the parent. Create does not write a per-chat grant.
- Idempotent `Sessions::Expire` and `ExpireSessionsJob`. Expiry closes by recording and root and does not require the creator's access.
- Recording Studio `~> 4.7` and Recording Studio AI `~> 0.15.1`. Recording Studio AI 0.15.1 rejects a provider session whose runs belong to another root.

### Upgrade notes
- Point host Gemfiles at Recording Studio `v4.7.0`, Recording Studio AI `v0.15.1`, and Recording Studio Metrics `v0.3.1`.
- Run `bin/rails generate recording_studio_agents:migrations`, then `bin/rails db:migrate`.
- Include `RecordingStudio::Capabilities::Agents.to` on each parent type that may own a chat, and add `RecordingStudioAgents::Session` to `config.recordable_types`.
- Schedule `RecordingStudioAgents::ExpireSessionsJob`.
